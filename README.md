# What

The Theatre is a streaming website created in html / css, javascript and php.

* We got inspired by Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and other Popcorn Time ... Our goal was to display a catalog of
movies. 

* We well spotted  the similarities between these platforms (navbar, header, search tool, different categories of videos…) 

Please find here below the UX prototype of our website at the first stage of its creation
