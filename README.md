# What

The Theatre is a streaming website created in html / css, javascript and php.

* We got inspired by Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and other Popcorn Time ... Our goal was to display a catalog of movies.

* We well spotted the similarities between these platforms (navbar, header, search tool, different categories of
  videos…)

Please find here below our very first sketches and UX prototype of our website which has been created at the planning stage the
Theatre :-)

[First UX-Prototype of our website](https://www.figma.com/proto/LZLTLgveLvyu8aBJbc3u1G/The-Theater?node-id=66%3A0&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1)

# How

- To setup this development environment you will need to have **docker** and
  **docker-compose** installed on you system.

- The Theatre Website includes a search bar and sort by filters, which have been developed in accordance with the
  flowchart attached below.

![search_flowchart_dark](pictures_README/search_flowchart_dark.jpg)

- The filter function of the Theatre displays the top movies. This function is enabled with the movie db API. This
  product uses the TMDb API.

- Our movie streaming website has the session system: registration, connection / disconnection. It also includes an
  Admin Dashboard which allows to keep under control upocoming visitors of the website.

- Registrants of the Theatre have the right to comment on the movies.

- Back office of the Theatre for user and comment management (CRUD) is also available.

# Why

Creating the video streaming website is an excellent task to bring together all the knowledge acquired so far. During
this task we used use php, js, css, Docker, bootstrap and tested our skills in group work. We also used the TMDb API,
which is an important part of the video streaming websites.

Today is a time of movie streaming websites. Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Disney HotStar are making much more money than
the theatres themselves. They stream not only movies but also web series, documentaries, etc. This means that the
streaming websites should guarantee a large working area for Wep Developers in the future.

The first commercial streaming product appeared in late 1992 and was named StarWorks. StarWorks enabled on-demand MPEG-1
full-motion videos to be randomly accessed on corporate Ethernet networks. Starworks was from Starlight Networks, who
also pioneered live video streaming on Ethernet and via Internet Protocol over satellites with Hughes Network Systems.
